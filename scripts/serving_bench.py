Parity: for n clean development records of decision-v7, the probabilities served in bf16 (eager, and through CUDA graphs:
the state-pass miss path and the cached-state hit path) against the fp32 eager path every reported number uses (max and
mean |dp|, argmax flips). Latency: model time (what /v1/systemone reports as latency_ms) for four request shapes, each
with a new state per request (the usual API call: every ticket is a new state) and with a repeated state (prefix cache
hit), eager and with graphs. Isolation (--isolation): on the same records through the served bf16 path, each question
alone against (a) the full request and (b) the question plus an unrelated sibling (kev.experiment.ISOLATION_PROBE); the
fp32 mechanism check (kev.experiment.mechanism_checks, 8 records, tolerance 1e-3) is exact arithmetic, this is the
precision the API serves. Every record is encoded as the server admits it (kev.model.admit: the serving context, strict),
so no read here runs on a cut state. Writes report.json.
