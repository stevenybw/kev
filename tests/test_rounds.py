"""The round harness (kev.rounds): spec validation, the benchmark job codec, the watcher's resume and network handling, and
reproduction of the committed read-outs and verdicts of rounds 5-20, 22 and 24 from saved rows (round 23's re-registration
uses round 24's rule verbatim), and round 20's temperature pools,
transfer reads and checkpoint arms on a synthetic round; the calibration guards (a temperature pool that shares data with
an arm's training is refused, every arm's temperature source is recorded, scripts/calibrate_checkpoint.py refuses
in-distribution rows) and calibration by state length; removed suites (kev.suite.REMOVED_SUITES: scienthoon-v1, archived
for the rounds that read it, refused after round 22; wanli-v2 and typesafe-v1, refused after round 26; wanli-v1, after
round 5), whose recorded reads reproduce from the committed rows.

Offline vs archive. Rounds 5-18 ran on the research branch; their trial rows, reads and most committed outputs live on the
git tag `research-archive-2026-09-24`, not on main. This checkout carries everything the round-5 read-out and the round-15
locked verdict need (the released Kev-0.8B's confirmation), so those two run everywhere, CI included. Round 19's read-out
runs wherever its trials' private development rows can be fetched (test_readout_reproduces_round_19); round 20's six
interpolations reproduce everywhere, its whole read-out where those rows can be fetched. Every other
reproduction skips unless KEV_ROUNDS_ROOT points at a checkout that has the rows and the outputs: a worktree of the tag
(`git worktree add /tmp/kev-archive research-archive-2026-09-24`, whose gitignored trial rows are not in git either) or the
checkout the rounds ran in:
    KEV_ROUNDS_ROOT=/path/to/kev uv run --extra serve python -m pytest tests/test_rounds.py -q
The per-round scripts (on the tag) wrote different key names for the same numbers; the legacy_* functions below map them.
Every number is compared: bit for bit on macOS, floats to 1e-12 relative elsewhere (same()).
