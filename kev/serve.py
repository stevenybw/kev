"""FastAPI sidecar for the playground: loads one checkpoint, exposes prefill-only decisions.

Run: uv run --extra serve python -m kev.serve --run runs/kev --port 8008

TypeSafe-compatible: POST /v1/systemone, GET /v1/models, the `x-typesafe-request-id` response header, and bearer auth
when KEV_API_KEY is set (unset = open server, the local default). Demo extras: POST /v1/systemone/permute (one Choice
under several option orders) and POST /v1/systemone/separate (each question in its own pass, for the packed-vs-separate
comparison). KEV_PREFIX_CACHE / KEV_PREFIX_MIN_TOKENS / KEV_PREFIX_MAX_TOKENS size the state-prefix cache; KEV_DATE_FACTS=1 opts into the
date preprocessing (api.with_date_facts). A state over kev.model.SERVE_MAX_STATE tokens is refused with a 422 (kev.model.admit);
KEV_TRUNCATE_STATES=1 reads its first SERVE_MAX_STATE tokens instead, and then every response says whether it did. Backend
and precision follow LoadOptions (KEV_BACKEND, KEV_DTYPE, ...): on Apple Silicon the hybrid Qwen3.5 checkpoints run on MLX
by default, elsewhere on torch in bf16.
