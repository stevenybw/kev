"""Registered research rounds as data: one spec per round, one engine for every stage.

A round (PLAN.md, rounds 5-20) always has the same shape. Arms are config-only trials (or checkpoints made from them,
round 20's interpolations) compared with a parent checkpoint;
each arm and its parent are read on a list of suites; a rule compares every arm with its parent on paired,
record-clustered bootstraps (primaries with a lower bound, guards with thresholds, pooled panels); the passing arm with
the best score is the size's candidate; confirmation stages (test partitions, the locked read) are read once. The spec
(`experiments/rounds/r<N>.json`, schema below) is committed before any training or read, like the PLAN registration it
encodes.

    uv run python -m kev.rounds validate      experiments/rounds/r18.json   # well-formed, every parent read exists, plans validate
    uv run python -m kev.rounds launch        experiments/rounds/r18.json   # modal_app.py::study for each study (after `modal deploy`)
    uv run python -m kev.rounds watch         experiments/rounds/r18.json   # pull + read each finished trial once, then the read-out
    uv run python -m kev.rounds launch-reads  experiments/rounds/r18.json [--arms a,b] [--stage tests --arm a]
    uv run python -m kev.rounds readout       experiments/rounds/r18.json   # -> runs/r18-readout/round18.json + a table
    uv run python -m kev.rounds confirm       experiments/rounds/r18.json --stage tests [--arm a]   # -> runs/r18-verdict/<size>-<stage>.json

Every comparison is served-vs-served: each side's rows are served at the temperature fitted on its own trial's
development rows (`kev.metrics.served`), or, for the arms of a round that registers a `temperature` pool, on that pool;
unknowable records are scored only by `unknowable_report`, and every delta is `kev.metrics.paired_bootstrap` (2,000
resamples, seed 0, micro), the registered read since round 5.

    locked_args  {size: [args]}       extra modal_app.py::locked_test switches for one size (a 27B's GPU memory)
    parents   {name: {trial, checkpoint?, reads: {tag: dir}}}   checkpoint (Hub id[@rev]) only when /<trial>/checkpoint is not on the volume

                                      default to arm_reads; select false = reported, never the candidate (attribution arms); an
                                      arm without a trial (an interpolated checkpoint) names its /runs/... checkpoint, needs the
                                      round's `temperature` pool (it has no development rows) and, if the rule reads
                                      "transfer", a transfer_read; trained_on [suite dirs] names what such a checkpoint was
                                      trained on (default: covered by the round's trial arms, e.g. the trials it interpolates)
    arm_reads template of an arm's read directory (default "runs/r{round}-{arm}-{tag}")
    transfer_read  a read tag (round level, or per arm, which wins; null = the trial's own) whose rows are an arm's "transfer"
                                      rows instead of its trial's in-trial transfer read (a checkpoint without a trial has none)
    temperature {reads: [tags], sources?: {tag: [source]}, exclude_reads?: [tags]}   every ARM (parents keep their trial's
                                      development rows) is served at the temperature fitted, as everywhere (kev.metrics.served),
                                      on the knowable rows of `reads` pooled (a read listed in `sources` gives only those
                                      sources' rows), minus every record whose id is in the `exclude_reads` rows; the arm's own
                                      rule-stage reads are used at every stage; no pooled tag may sit in a panel that a
                                      temperature-dependent criterion reads (see pool_problems), and no pooled read may share
                                      data with any arm's training data (pool_training_problems: round 19's failure mode)
    drop_ids  record ids dropped on both sides of every comparison (devtools-v1's duplicated ids)
    rule      {panels, unknowable?, criteria, rank}
    confirm   {stage: {candidate_reads, parent_reads?, panels, criteria}}
A panel is {reads: [tags], metrics: [bootstrapped], report: [value only], source?: filter, versus?: {name: dir}, by_length?,
exclude_sources?, exclude_tasks?, exclude_file?, optional?}; the tag "transfer" is the trial's own in-trial transfer read (or
the arm's transfer_read). source keeps one source (or a list of them); exclude_sources / exclude_tasks drop rows by source /
task, and exclude_file ({path, sha256}: a JSON object of `ids` (question or record ids), `sources` and `tasks` lists, or a
bare list of any of them) drops what it lists, checked against its registered hash, so a private list (round 24's
tasksource-heldout families) enters a public spec only as a path and a sha256 (panel_filter; the same rows leave both
sides and any `versus` reference; the panel records how many questions they removed as `excluded`). optional: true marks
a report-only panel no criterion or rank may read; its absent reads leave the comparison complete (`missing_optional`).
The `temperature` pool may carry ci: {level, samples, seed}, which adds each arm's bootstrap interval of its pooled
temperature to the read-out (`temperature_ci`, report only). by_length (true, or {edges?:
[tokens], tokenizer?: [name, revision]}) adds acc / ece / brier / confident_error_rate per state-token bucket
(kev.metrics.calibration_by_length: "<metric>_<bucket>" entries, e.g. ece_16k_plus, value only) with state tokens counted
from the reads' suite records. A criterion is {left, op, right, plus?} where left is a path
("<panel>.<metric>.<candidate|parent|delta|lower|upper>", "<panel>.<metric>_<bucket>.<candidate|parent>",
"unknowable.<candidate|parent>") or a list [a, b] meaning a - b, and right is a number or a path (plus is added to it).
rank is a list of {by: path | [paths summed], order}.

Every arm's read-out records where its temperature came from (`temperature_source`: the pool with its reads and question
count, or its trial's development rows with their suite) and its parent's (`parent_temperature_source`: its trial's
development rows, plus `shipped`, the head.pt temperature when it is here), and the printed table warns when an arm's rows
are a training corpus's (in distribution: round 19's failure mode). From round 21 (POOL_REQUIRED_FROM) a rule or
confirmation with a temperature-dependent criterion must register a `temperature` pool: validate and launch refuse it
otherwise; earlier rounds get a warning, so their recorded specs keep validating.

Removed suites (kev.suite.REMOVED_SUITES: evals/external/scienthoon-v1, removed 2026-09-27, last read by round 22;
evals/external/wanli-v2 and typesafe-v1, removed 2026-09-30, last read by round 26; wanli-v1, last read by round 5). A round
up to the suite's `last_round` that reads one validates with the read listed under `archived`; its read-out and
confirmations are computed from the committed rows as before (they need rows, not the suite). A later round that names
one is refused with the reason, and no read of one is launched again (read_commands skips it; kev.suite.load_split refuses it).
